## Login System Using Next Js and Mern :reminder_ribbon:

My first web app using next js with react and I have make login and signup page where user enter email and password 
that will be store in mongodb using mongoose 

This web is fully authenticate because of following reason

1) Used a cookies based login
2) User cannot directly go to profile page without login because middleware has been used in this web
3) Token based verification ,Reset Password and User verify

## Tech Stack :dart:
1) Mongodb
2) Mailtrap
3) Next Js
4) React Js
